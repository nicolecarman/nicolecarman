### I'm a software engineering student and self-taught web developer.
Welcome to my Github profile! It's new, but I'm focused on learning and am actively working on my growth as a developer.

- :open_book: I'm currently participating in a 16-week JS/Java boot camp
- üñ•Ô∏è Approx. 20 years of self-taught web dev and graphic design experience
- üß∞ I'm flexible and am always open to learning new languages and tools
- üí¨ I enjoy collaboration and teamwork
- üëç Goals for 2022: contribute more to open source, focus on JavaScript and Java

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Languages and Tools:
These are the languages and tools I'm most familiar with. I started learning HTML, CSS, and mySQL in the early 2000s, began learning C++ in 2021 in my university coursework, and I'm currently learning JavaScript and Java as a part of a 16-week software engineering boot camp.
