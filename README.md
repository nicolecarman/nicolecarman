### I'm a software engineer and web developer
Welcome to my Github profile! I am currently working full-time as a software engineer, and I'm a self-taught web developer who has just over 20 years of experience in front end development. I have the same experience in graphic design, social media marketing, and graphic design. In 2022, I created Nerds Who Code, an inclusive Discord community for people who code or who want to learn how to code (<a href="https://github.com/Nerds-Who-Code">Nerds Who Code Github</a>).

- :open_book: I enjoy self-learning and learning new ways to solve problems
- :briefcase: I'm flexible and always open to learning new languages, tools, and frameworks
- :white_check_mark: Goals for 2023: complete 1 codewars challenge/day, learn Python

### Languages and Tools:
I started learning HTML, CSS, and mySQL in the early 2000s. I'm also familiar with C++, Java, Javascript, and Python.
