### Languages and Tools:
These are the languages and tools I'm most familiar with. I have over 15 years of experience with website and graphic design tools. I took two Visual Basic programming classes in high school, and I started learning C++ in 2021 in my university coursework. I started learning JavaScript on my own in 2022, and my goal is to start becoming familiar with C#/.NET and Python this year.
