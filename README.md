- 🆕 My portfolio is brand new (April 2022), but I will begin uploading projects this summer (after spring semester)


### Languages and Tools:
Here are the languages and tools I'm most familiar with. I'm learning C++ in my university coursework. My goal is to start dabbling in C#/.NET, Python, and JavaScript. I am always open to learning new languages and tools.
